Does this following sound like something you could "code-up" while brewing coffee? 

1. Read in a raw fits file from HERMES. 

2. Make a column-cut (or line cut) along the file and produce a plot that shows the peak counts from each star_fiber/sky_fiber (implot in IRAF can do this, but it would be useful to be able to mask out certain regions and/or zoom in as necessary) 

3. Estimate the total counts for each star_fiber/sky_fiber and make a histogram showing the distribution of those counts. (This would require some knowledge of where each fibre falls on the CCD, the FWHM, the baseline counts etc.) 

As you may recall from a HERMES meeting in Sydney in July(?), such a code was suggested as being a very useful tool to enable the observers at the AAT to estimate if S/N=100 (or whatever number is appropriate) has been obtained for some useful fraction of the stars observed. 

I could try to do this, but it would be (a) ugly and (b) slow because I use IDL. As I mumbled to Sarah, "I'll learn python/a_useful_code if/when I get tenure". If you wanted to, I reckon you could do it in < 42 lines of code.
